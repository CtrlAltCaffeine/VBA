Subject: Request for Rescheduling Drop Timing to 6 PM - Operational Work

Dear India Admin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a rescheduling of my drop timing to 6 PM due to the operational work I am currently engaged in. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter.

As you may be aware, I am involved in crucial operational tasks that require my focused attention and dedication. These tasks have unexpectedly extended beyond regular working hours, making it challenging for me to adhere to the existing drop timing. By rescheduling the drop timing to 6 PM, I will have sufficient time to wrap up my operational responsibilities and ensure a smooth transition before concluding my workday.

I understand that the current drop timing has been established for the convenience of all team members, and I greatly value the collaborative environment we have. However, the nature of my operational work demands flexibility, and I believe that this adjustment will enhance my efficiency and productivity, ultimately benefiting the entire team.

I assure you that this request is solely driven by the demands of my operational role, and I remain committed to fulfilling my duties and responsibilities to the best of my abilities. I am willing to discuss this matter further or provide any additional information that may be required to support my request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your favorable response and appreciate your assistance in accommodating this rescheduling request.

Yours sincerely,

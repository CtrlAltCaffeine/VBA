Subject: Internship Extension Confirmation and Appreciation

Dear Tarun,

I hope this email finds you well. Following our conversation on 7th June, I wanted to inform you that I have successfully obtained approval from my college to extend my internship.

I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work with the pricing and valuation team. The exposure I have gained to coding, dashboard creation, and the world of finance has been incredibly valuable. My interests align perfectly with this internship extension, as it provides me with an ideal environment to learn and grow.

I sincerely appreciate the chance to continue my work here and contribute to the team's objectives. I am excited about the potential to deepen my skills, take on more responsibilities, and make a meaningful impact.

Thank you once again for this opportunity. I am grateful to be a part of this team and look forward to further collaboration in the future.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
